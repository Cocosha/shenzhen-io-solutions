SHENZHEN I/O Solutions
======================

My solutions to the imaginary micro-controller programming game [SHENZHEN I/O](http://www.zachtronics.com/shenzhen-io/).

The raw save files are not exactly human readable, so solution screenshots are also included.

Somehow my [solution repo](https://github.com/sunzenshen/tis-100-solutions) for another imaginary programming game TIS-100 had a small readership, so may as well post solutions for this game as well.
If these save games are useful or interesting,
take comfort that I don't really care to enforce some arbitrary copyright on some fun game related code;
just don't inexplicably harm yourself with it (though that would be impressive, given the imaginary architecture!).
That said, since I'm planning on posting unoptimized solutions before I complete a first full pass of the game, I'm sure you (dear reader) can do much better with some careful [code bumming](http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/b/bum.html).

Enjoy!
